In Igbo culture, there's a strong value placed on justice (ikpe ziri ezi) and communal decision-making, so people expect some level of fairness, especially in visible public roles. However, due to Nigeria’s history of electoral malpractice and the influence of \"godfatherism,\" complete trust is rare, but it’s not entirely absent. Many believe that officials try to do their jobs well, but systemic challenges sometimes prevent absolute fairness, leading to the choice of \"fairly often.\""}]}

Fairly often**\n\nIn Nigeria, especially among the Igbo and other ethnic groups, it is widely acknowledged that voter bribery happens \"fairly often\" during elections. While many people are aware of incidents where politicians distribute money, food, or gifts to sway voters, it is not seen as something that happens everywhere or to everyone in every election. Cultural values such as \"Ime Ego\" (making money) and communal sharing can sometimes blur the lines between genuine generosity and bribery, making such practices somewhat normalized but not universal.
