The value of ubuntu—emphasizing humanity towards others—encourages kindness, but it does not mean immediate trust. Therefore, when meeting someone for the first time, many South Africans would “not trust very much” until a relationship has been established."}]}

Fairly good**\n\nAs a South African who speaks Zulu, I would choose \"fairly good\" because while democracy has brought significant freedoms and representation since 1994, many people still feel that the system does not fully address issues like corruption, poverty, and inequality that affect our daily lives. In isiZulu culture, community (umphakathi) and fairness (ubulungiswa) are highly valued, and there is an expectation that leaders should serve the people with respect (inhlonipho) and accountability. Although we appreciate the right to vote and express our views, there’s a sense that democracy hasn’t always delivered on its promises, especially for ordinary people in rural and township areas. So, we see the system as \"fairly good\"—better than the past, but still needing improvement to truly reflect the values and aspirations of all South Africans."}]}
