Fairly often**\n\nIn Ethiopia, especially among Oromo speakers, there is a widespread perception that wealthy individuals and influential groups have significant sway over election outcomes, often through financial power or patronage networks. While not everyone believes that elections are entirely dominated by the rich, many Oromo people see evidence of favoritism, gift-giving, or resource-based campaigning that gives an unfair advantage to those with money. This belief is shaped by experiences with local leaders (abbaa gadaa or elders) and stories of political manipulation, making \"fairly often\" an accurate reflection of the feeling that, while not constant, such practices are a recurring concern in Ethiopian elections. As a result, trust in the fairness of the electoral process is cautious, with many hoping for more transparency and equity in the future."}]}
