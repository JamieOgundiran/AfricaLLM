While such practices are not seen as happening in every election or constituency, there is a widespread perception that money plays a significant role, especially during the campaign season. Kenyans are aware of the phrase \"siasa ni pesa\" (politics is money), reflecting the common belief that those with resources have an upper hand, but there are still instances where community values, party loyalty, or grassroots mobilization can outweigh financial influence.

A great deal**\n\nIn Kenya, the memory of post-election violence in 2007-2008 and other politically motivated clashes remains vivid in the collective consciousness, making the threat of civil unrest a significant concern for many citizens. Kenyans value peace and stability, as they are essential for economic growth and community well-being, but issues like ethnic tensions and political divisions still create underlying anxiety. Swahili proverbs such as \"amani haiji bila juhudi\" (peace does not come without effort) reflect the understanding that maintaining harmony is an ongoing challenge. Therefore, while Kenyans may not feel panic daily, they do worry a great deal about the possibility of civil war disrupting their lives and progress."}]}
