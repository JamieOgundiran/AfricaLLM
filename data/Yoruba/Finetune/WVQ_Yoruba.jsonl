Fairly often**\n\nAs a Yoruba-Nigerian, I would say election officials are fair \"fairly often\" because while there are issues of corruption and bias, many officials still strive to uphold integrity due to strong cultural values around honesty (ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́) and community reputation. In Yoruba society, elders and leaders are expected to act as good role models (àpẹẹrẹ rere), and this expectation sometimes influences officials to conduct themselves properly, especially in urban areas or where community scrutiny is high. However, the reality of Nigerian politics means that fairness is not guaranteed all the time, so \"fairly often\" reflects a balance between optimism in our traditional values and realism about the political environment. This answer acknowledges both the positive efforts of some officials and the systemic challenges that exist."}]}

People acknowledge that \"money speaks,\" but also believe in the power of collective resistance and the role of elders (agba) and kingmakers in moderating excesses. Therefore, a Yoruba Nigerian might say that rich people buying elections happens \"fairly often,\" recognizing the influence of wealth but not considering it absolute."}]}

Traditional respect for authority and elders sometimes discourages open confrontation, but the presence of security forces is not always enough to prevent these threats. Thus, while not every election is violent, the perception remains that voter intimidation happens \"fairly often\" due to these repeated experiences and societal narratives."}]}
