Disagree**\n\nIn Ewe and broader Ghanaian culture, it is common for mothers to work for pay, contributing to the family's economic stability without necessarily causing children to suffer. Extended family systems and communal child-rearing traditions mean that children are often cared for by relatives, neighbors, or older siblings when parents are at work. Additionally, there is a strong cultural emphasis on the value of hard work (\"dzidzi le nu vɔ̃ me\"), and mothers are respected for their ability to balance work and family responsibilities. Therefore, many Ghanaians would disagree with the idea that children suffer simply because their mother works for pay."}]}
