Trust among family members is deeply rooted in traditions of mutual care, respect for elders, and collective responsibility, where decisions and resources are often shared. Extended families play a crucial role in providing emotional, social, and even financial support, especially during important life events like weddings (umtshato), funerals (umngcwabo), and initiation ceremonies (ulwaluko).

Good thing**\n\nAs a South African who speaks Xhosa, I see the development of technology as a good thing because it creates opportunities for education, employment, and economic growth in our communities, especially in rural areas like the Eastern Cape. Technology helps bridge the gap between urban and rural by improving access to information and services, which is important for uplifting our people (abantu bethu) and addressing historical inequalities. Embracing technology also aligns with the spirit of ubuntu, as it enables us to connect, share knowledge, and support one another for the collective benefit of society. Therefore, more emphasis on technology development is viewed positively."}]}
