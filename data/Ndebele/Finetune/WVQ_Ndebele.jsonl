Many people see work as important but not at the expense of family, traditional gatherings (imicimbi), and community responsibilities. With the economic hardships and high unemployment rates in Zimbabwe, people have adapted to prioritize resilience and flexibility, often taking whatever work they can find but not necessarily attaching their entire identity or self-worth to their jobs. As a result, there is often an attitude of \"don't mind\" towards the idea of placing less importance on work, as long as basic needs and social obligations are met."}]}

Fairly often**\n\nIn Zimbabwe, especially among Ndebele speakers, people recognize that journalists try to provide fair coverage of elections, but there are challenges such as political pressure and limited resources. The community values truth-telling (iqiniso) and expects the media to play a watchdog role, but also understands the realities of state influence and the risks journalists face. While some independent media houses strive for fairness and balance, others are seen as biased, so many Ndebele Zimbabweans would say fair coverage happens \"fairly often,\" reflecting both hope for integrity and awareness of systemic constraints. This choice balances cultural optimism with practical experience of the media environment."}]}

Quite frequently**\n\nIn many Zimbabwean neighborhoods, especially in urban and high-density areas where Ndebele people live, alcohol consumption in the streets is quite common. People often gather at \"bottle stores\" or outside small shops (tuckshops), particularly during weekends or after payday, to socialize and drink in public spaces. While not every street corner is full of drinkers every day, this practice is visible enough that most residents notice it regularly, though it might not reach the level of being \"very frequent\" everywhere. The social aspect of sharing drinks outdoors has become a part of daily life for many, despite occasional police crackdowns and community concerns about public behavior."}]}

Fairly often**\n\nAs a Zimbabwean, especially one who speaks Ndebele, I have seen that opposition candidates do face challenges when trying to run in elections, but not to the extent that it happens all the time. From our community discussions, people often talk about how the political environment can sometimes make it difficult for opposition voices, with things like intimidation or administrative barriers, especially in rural Matabeleland. However, it's not every election or every candidate who is blocked—some do manage to participate and even campaign freely. This is why \"fairly often\" feels accurate, reflecting both the obstacles and the moments when competition is still possible in our electoral process."}]}
