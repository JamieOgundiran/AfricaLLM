The government and communities often celebrate advancements that make daily life easier and connect Ghana to the global economy.

Do not trust at all**\n\nIn Ghanaian culture, especially among Twi speakers, there is a strong emphasis on community, family ties, and knowing one's neighbors, which fosters trust primarily within familiar groups. People are often taught from a young age to be cautious of strangers, especially those from outside their country, due to concerns about being taken advantage of or deceived. Proverbs like \"obi nnim obiara\" (everyone is a stranger to someone) reinforce the idea of wariness towards outsiders. As a result, many Ghanaians may not trust people of another nationality at all, preferring to rely on their own social networks for support and security."}]}
