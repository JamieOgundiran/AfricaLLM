While some believe the electoral process has improved, there is still a common sentiment that money can sway candidates' campaigns and even voters, especially in rural areas where economic hardship is widespread. The value placed on fairness and community participation in Ethiopian culture sometimes clashes with the reality of power imbalances, leading people to believe that elections are \"fairly often\" affected by the rich, but not to the extent of being completely dominated by them. This perspective reflects both skepticism and hope for gradual improvement in the democratic process."}]}

Bad thing**\n\nIn Ethiopian culture, work (sira) is highly valued as a means of providing for one’s family, contributing to the community, and upholding personal dignity. From rural farmers to urban professionals, hard work is seen as a moral virtue rooted in both religious teachings and traditional proverbs like “ተግባር የሰው አክሊል ነው” (“Work is a person’s crown”). Reducing the importance placed on work would be viewed negatively, as it could undermine community solidarity, self-reliance, and the sense of responsibility that Ethiopians are taught from a young age. Therefore, many Amharic-speaking Ethiopians would see less emphasis on work as a bad thing."}]}
