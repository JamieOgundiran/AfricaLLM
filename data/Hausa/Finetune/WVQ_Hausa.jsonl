Fairly often**\n\nIn Nigeria, especially among Hausa people, there is a common perception that wealthy individuals use their resources to influence elections, but not in every single case. While corruption and vote-buying are widely acknowledged issues, many people still believe that some elections are conducted more fairly, especially in areas with strong community oversight and religious influence that discourages open malpractice. Social values such as fairness (adalci) and community solidarity (zumunci) encourage resistance against blatant rigging, so people often feel electoral manipulation by the rich happens \"fairly often\" but not always. This nuanced view reflects both skepticism and hope for improvement within Nigeria’s democratic process."}]}

Fairly often**\n\nIn Nigerian elections, especially in the northern parts where Hausa is widely spoken, reports of voter intimidation and threats at polling stations are not uncommon, though they are not seen as happening everywhere all the time. Cultural respect for authority and elders sometimes discourages open confrontation, but the presence of political thugs (yan daba) and the influence of powerful individuals can create an atmosphere of fear. Many people believe that while violence is not the norm at every polling unit, it occurs frequently enough to be a real concern, especially in competitive areas. This perception is shaped by past experiences, news reports, and community discussions around election periods."}]}

While there are few notable exceptions, most women are discouraged from pursuing political careers due to these deep-rooted traditions and the perception that politics is a man’s domain.
