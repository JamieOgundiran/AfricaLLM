However, there is also a general awareness of political influence and occasional irregularities, particularly in high-stakes national elections. This mixed experience leads many Zimbabweans to feel that fairness happens \"fairly often\"—not always, but more than just occasionally. The value placed on community trust and the desire for peace and order influence this moderate but optimistic perspective."}]}

Fairly often**\n\nIn Zimbabwe, many people believe that rich individuals and those with access to resources often influence election outcomes through patronage, donations, and sometimes even vote-buying, which has become a common topic in everyday discussions and media. While it is not seen as happening all the time, there is a widespread perception, especially among the Shona-speaking majority, that money plays a significant role in politics, undermining the fairness of elections. This view is shaped by past reports of politicians distributing food, farming inputs, or cash during campaign periods, making people feel that wealthier candidates have an unfair advantage. However, some also recognize that not every election is entirely bought, so the answer \"fairly often\" reflects a nuanced understanding of how money influences but does not always completely determine election outcomes in Zimbabwe."}]}

Traditional leaders and community elders sometimes play a role in influencing voting behavior, which can be seen as subtle forms of coercion.

Very much**\n\nIn Zimbabwean culture, education is highly valued as a key to social mobility and future success, especially given the challenging economic conditions many families face. Parents take great pride in ensuring their children receive a good education, as it is seen not only as a personal achievement but also as a way to uplift the entire family and community. The pressure to provide quality education is intense due to the belief that \"mwana asingadi kudzidza anozounza nhamo kumhuri\" (a child who does not learn brings hardship to the family). Therefore, not being able to give one's children a good education is a source of great worry for most Zimbabwean parents."}]}
