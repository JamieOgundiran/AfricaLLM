Fairly often**\n\nIn Rwandan culture, honesty and integrity are valued, especially after the country's history of conflict and the emphasis on unity and reconciliation (ubumwe n’ubwiyunge). Many Rwandans believe that fair elections contribute to good governance and economic development, but they also recognize that other factors like strong leadership (ubuyobozi bwiza), community cooperation (ubufatanye), and government initiatives play significant roles. For this reason, honest elections are seen as \"fairly often\" important for economic development, but not the only determining factor. This perspective reflects the pragmatic and communal approach of Rwandans, who often look beyond a single aspect to the broader picture of national progress."}]}
